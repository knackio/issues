## Contributing

We're working hard to open-source a number of awesome coding patterns that we've developed and we'd love to get as many people involved as possible. Our main areas of focus are:

* **Next.js + Serverless Components**
* **AWS CDK with Typescript**
* **The Serverless Framework**
* **React.js + Serverless GraphQL**
* **React Native/Expo + Serverless GraphQL**

The more we all share with each other, the more successful we can all be. If you're interested in contributing to our open-source projects, email us at [dev@knack.io](mailto:dev@knack.io) or join our [Telegram Community](https://t.me/knackio).
